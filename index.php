                Hello! <br />
                <p>Welcome to my site!</p>
                <p>This is a personal site where I'm going to talk a little bit about myself, but more specifically about my dog.  
                This is my dog Ava.  She's a Papillon, which is French for butterfly.  It's also a Steve McQueen movie about a 
                French counterfeiter with a butterfly tattoo that escapes from Devil's Island with the help of Dustin Hoffman.  
                Ava weighs only three pounds and is thirteen years old.</p>
                <p>I have another dog named Pancake that we found in the wreckage of a burned down neighborhood in Santa Rosa, 
                California after a wildfire
                destroyed most of the houses.</p>
